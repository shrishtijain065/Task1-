# Task1-
Task1 is regarding decision tree implementation.

Happy to share that I’ve successfully implemented a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn on the classic Iris dataset — a fundamental step in any machine learning journey!

🔍 Project Highlights:

Utilized DecisionTreeClassifier from scikit-learn

Explored the dataset’s features and visualized class distributions

Trained the model to classify Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica

Achieved high accuracy with proper train/test split

Visualized the decision tree using plot_tree() for better interpretability 🌿

This project strengthened my understanding of:
✔️ Feature selection & splitting criteria (Gini vs. Entropy)
✔️ Model training and evaluation
✔️ Tree visualization and overfitting control (via max_depth, min_samples_split)

Looking forward to building more models and diving deeper into ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting! 🚀
